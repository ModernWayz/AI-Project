# Kernel Transformer Networks


{: .warning }
> This code repo has deprecated code and is very hard to implement!

[Github Repo](https://github.com/sammy-su/KernelTransformerNetwork){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 }

This technology could be used to implement existing CNNs onto 360° imagery.
KTN takes the existing models as input and connects the KTN layer to the 360° output.
This makes the KTN transferable across models.
